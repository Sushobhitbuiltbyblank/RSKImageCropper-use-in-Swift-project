# RSKImageCropper-use-in-Swift-project
I have just implemented RSKImageCropper library to crop image in my Swift Project. link - https://github.com/ruslanskorb/RSKImageCropper
Very usefull library for cropping. 
In my project user can capture image from camera or choose image from gallery. 
Crop that image by using RSKImageCropper library.
you can also update the pod file if RSKImageCropper library not download on cloning or download.
I have used latest xcode Version 8.3.2 (8E2002), with latest Swift version 3.1
